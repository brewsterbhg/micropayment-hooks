## Overview

This library provides a way to hook into dispatched micropayment events in order to create a tiered system where you control what happens after set thresholds have been reached. Experience is determined by the payment amount (which can be controlled with a multiplier). Callback functions are exposed on experience update and level up functions to integrate into your own applications.

## Requirements

Check out the official Web Monetization [Quick Start Guide](https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started) to learn how to set up a wallet for receiving payments. This library assumes you have a meta tag with both the `name="moneization"` and `content={your payment pointer}` properties. Example:

```
<meta
  name="monetization"
  content="$wallet.example.com/alice"
>
```

## Installation

```
npm install micropayment-hooks --save
```

## Example

```
const hooks = new MicropaymentHooks();

hooks.init({
    level: 1,
    xp: 0,
    levelThresholds: [10, 20, 50],
    multiplier: 1000,
    onXPUpdate: (xp) => console.log(xp),
    onLevelUp: (level) => console.log(level),
});
```
